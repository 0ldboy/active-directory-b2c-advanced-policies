This sample demonstrate one approach to create a just in time migration policy.  The user is migrated from an Azure SQL data store (userprofileapi.azurewebsites.net) into a the b2c tenant (casalaolab2c.onmicrosoft.com) as part of what appears to the user to be a normal signin journey.

The userid and password provided by the user during the login session is used in a  REST API call to an azure app (Visual studio project included as Contoso.B2C.WebApi) which reads and writes to the SQL Data store.  This web app also creates users in the directory (casalaola.onmicrosoft.com),mapping existing claims to new directory, in effect migrating the user just in time without disruption.

General steps to repro experience:
1. Configure the advanced policies complete with its trustframework in the advanced tenant.
1a. B2C_1A_Demo_Base
1b. B2C_1A_Demo_SungupOrSignin
2. Open the project (Contoso.B2C.WebApi)
3. Create the Azure sql database (or use existing store) -note the structure of the DB is important.  You must create a table (see CreateB2CTable under Models folder)  (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2016 was used to edit the database and create demo users)
4. Update web.config  in the project to include credentials to access database
5. Update web.config to include the app-based credentials to give the web app access to the user store via Graph
6. Review powerpoint included to review the meaning of "status"
7. Create a few users to be migrated . see Excel for sample
8. Invoke policy B2C_1A_Demo_SignuporSignin to test.
9. Login one of the demo users and they should migrate to the b2c tenant
